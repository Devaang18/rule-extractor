You are enhancing pre-extracted rules for RAG optimization and user review.

TASK:
1. Take the provided JSON array of rules.
2. Do not change the array structure or field names.
3. Each rule includes these fields: "rule_text", "context", "tags", "category".
4. Improve each rule for clarity, specificity, and RAG effectiveness:
   - Enhance "rule_text" for better standalone comprehension
   - Expand "context" where additional explanation is needed
   - Improve "tags" for better searchability and categorization
   - Ensure "category" is present and correct
5. Ensure output is valid JSON with no extra commentary.

ENHANCEMENT CRITERIA:
- "rule_text" should be unambiguous, actionable, and self-contained for RAG retrieval
- "context" should provide necessary background without duplicating rule_text
- "tags" should be specific, searchable, and cover all key concepts
- "category" must be exactly one of: Marketing, Gambling, Legal, Compliance. If missing or incorrect, assign the best-fitting single category.

RAG OPTIMIZATION:
- Ensure each rule can be retrieved and understood independently
- Use consistent terminology across related rules
- Make rule_text searchable with relevant keywords
- Provide sufficient context for accurate interpretation

OUTPUT:
- Return only the enhanced JSON array, no extra text.
- Maintain all original field names and structure.
- Ensure all rules have complete and accurate information, including a valid "category".
